# NLP Text Classification

Welcome to the NLP Text Classification project! This repository houses a simple yet powerful tool designed to classify text as either positive or negative. Built upon natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project employs an Amazon CSV file containing reviews of a particular item for training.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to harness the power of NLP in text classification. Leveraging NLTK for text preprocessing and employing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, the system is capable of discerning the sentiment of textual data accurately.

## Technologies Used

- **NLTK**: Utilized for comprehensive text preprocessing, including tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and more.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: These frameworks form the backbone of our machine learning model, facilitating the implementation of the RNN for classification tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions outlined in the documentation. You'll need to install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment to begin training and using the classification model effectively.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different parameters, and contribute to enhancing the functionality of the project.

Let's embark on a journey into the realm of NLP text classification together!
